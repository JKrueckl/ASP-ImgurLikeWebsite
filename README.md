# ASP-ImgurLikeWebsite
This was a proof of concept webpage I made for a class.

I used HTML5, CSS, and ASP.NET for the creation of this website

Notes:
  - The login system only determines what pictures to display in the users album ( There is no authentication )
  
Function:
  - The webpage will save images (jpgs) only to the logged in username's file
